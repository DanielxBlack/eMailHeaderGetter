# Email Header Getter Thing

This isn't anything really awesome. I just made it because I wanted to build something that let me pull relevant information from email headers.

It uses a bit of Regex and some cool Python packages that validate IP addresses.

It's nothing special, but as with anything, it was a learning experience. Really, that's all my GitHub is about for now. As time goes on, I will build things that are more useful.
